# Weather App Usage Analysis

This is a data science project that analyzes data and patterns behind weather app usage and was used as my final project for COGS 137 at UCSD (Practical Data Science in R).

## Introduction

Weather plays a significant role in our daily lives, from influencing our daily activities to impacting agriculture, transportation, and even our safety. In recent years, the effects of climate change have become increasingly apparent, and extreme weather events have become more frequent and severe. In this context, staying informed about weather conditions has become more crucial than ever before.

This report investigates the weather checking habits of Americans, aiming to understand how often people check the weather, what methods they use to get weather updates, and any regional or generational differences in weather checking habits. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into how Americans stay informed about weather conditions, and identify areas where we can improve weather communication and education.
The report also examines the regional and generational differences in weather checking habits, highlighting how factors such as location and age can influence how people stay informed about weather conditions.

Overall, this report provides valuable insights into the weather checking habits of Americans, shedding light on how we can improve weather communication and education to better prepare for extreme weather events and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Using data collected from a SurveyMonkey survey, adults from across America were asked whether they typically checked a daily weather report, how they checked the weather, and some information about their demographics. We used the data collected to answer the following questions.

## Questions

- Is there a relationship between whether a person typically checks their weather app and their sex?
- Does weather app use differ based on where the respondent is located?
- Is there a relationship between household income and weather app?
- What is the most popular website/app used to check the weather?
- Can we predict whether a person typically checks the daily weather report based on the method they use to check the weather and their demographic information?
